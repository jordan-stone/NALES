## Primary Author

- **Jordan Stone** - Original nales development and ongoing maintenance

## Code Contributors

- **Zackery Briesemeister** - Sub-pixel registration and spot-spoofing algorithms
  developed for the MEAD pipeline (Briesemeister et al. 2018, SPIE 10702) and
  incorporated back into nales.

## Heritage

nales and MEAD share a collaborative development history:

1. **ALES** (original) - Initial ALES data reduction pipeline developed by
   Jordan Stone at Steward Observatory.

2. **MEAD** - Extended pipeline developed by Zackery Briesemeister at UC Santa
   Cruz, incorporating and improving upon ALES algorithms.

3. **nales** (current) - new ALES, Continued development incorporating improvements from
   the MEAD collaboration, and accommodating instrument upgrades.
